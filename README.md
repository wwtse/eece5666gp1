The project is a DSP course project. We mostly used MATLAB to design the filters for IMU datasets. 

The three types of the dataset are from 1. quadcopter, 2. offered by group members, 3.LSM9DS1 IMU embedded ARDUINO NANO 33 BLE SENSE. We used PuTTY to log the signal. 
In the filtering process, three filters being used. Two lowpass filters to reject the noise and one complementay filter to combine the accelerometer and gyrometer data.
